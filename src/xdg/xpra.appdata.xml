 <description>
  <p>
   Xpra is a persistent remote display server and client for X11
   applications and desktops.
  </p>
  <p>
    Xpra is "screen for X": it allows you to run X programs, usually
    on a remote host, direct their display to your local machine, and
    then to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same
    or another machine, without losing any state. It gives you remote
    access to individual applications. Xpra also allows forwarding of
    sound, clipboard and printing services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Xpra is "rootless" or "seamless": programs you run under it show
    up on your desktop as regular programs, managed by your regular
    window manager.  Sessions can be accessed over SSH, or password
    protected over plain TCP sockets.  Xpra is usable over reasonably
    slow links and does its best to adapt to changing network
    bandwidth constraints.

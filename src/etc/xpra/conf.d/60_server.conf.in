# examples:
#start-child = /usr/bin/xterm

# The difference between start and start-child is only relevant

# This causes the server to terminate when the last child has exited:

# Start a dbus-daemon:

# Systemd specific options:
# Wrap server start commands with systemd-run:

#systemd-run = auto

# Command line arguments passed to systemd-run:

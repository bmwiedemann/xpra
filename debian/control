Description: tool to detach/reattach running X programs
 Xpra gives you the functionality of GNU Screen for X applications.
 .
 It allows the user to view remote X applications on their local machine, and
 disconnect and reconnect from the remote machine without losing the state of
 the running applications.
 .
 Unlike VNC, these applications are "rootless".  They appear as individual
 windows inside your window manager rather than being contained within a single
 window.

Description: library for writing window managers, using GTK+
 A helper library for writing window managers.
 .
 As the author says, wimpiggy is "a library to make writing fancypants,
 EWMH-compliant, compositing window managers just as easy as writing an app in
 PyGTK+."
